#
### Getting Started
1\. First of all you need to clone E Space repository from github:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RedberryInternship/giorgi-tseradze-movie-quotes.git
```

2\. Next step requires you to run *composer install* in order to install all the dependencies.
```sh
composer install
```

3\. after you have installed all the PHP dependencies, it's time to install all the JS dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

and also:
```sh
npm run dev
```
in order to build your JS/SaaS resources.

4\. Now we need to set our env file. Go to the root of your project and execute this command.
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```
And now you should provide **.env** file all the necessary environment variables:

#
**MYSQL:**
>DB_CONNECTION=mysql

>DB_HOST=127.0.0.1

>DB_PORT=3306

>DB_DATABASE=*****

>DB_USERNAME=*****

>DB_PASSWORD=*****


##### Now, you should be good to go!


#
### Migration
if you've completed getting started section, then migrating database if fairly simple process, just execute:
```sh
php artisan migrate
```

#
### Running Unit tests
Running unit tests also is very simple process, just type in following command:

```sh
composer test
```

#
### Development

You can run Laravel's built-in development server by executing:

```sh
  php artisan serve
```

when working on JS you may run:

```sh
  npm run dev
```
it builds your js files into executable scripts.
If you want to watch files during development, execute instead:

```sh
  npm run watch
```
it will watch JS files and on change it'll rebuild them, so you don't have to manually build them.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
